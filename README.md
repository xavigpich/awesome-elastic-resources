# Awesome Elastic Resources

## Elastic Stack
* [Elasticsearch](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch) - Elasticsearch is the distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine at the heart of the Elastic Stack
* [Logstash](https://github.com/elastic/logstash) - Logstash is a server-side data processing pipeline that ingests data from a multitude of sources simultaneously, transforms it, and then sends it to your favorite "stash."
* [Kibana](https://github.com/elastic/kibana) - Kibana is your window into the Elastic Stack. Specifically, it's a browser-based analytics and search dashboard for Elasticsearch
* [Beats](https://github.com/elastic/beats) - Beats are lightweight data shippers, written in Go, that you install on your servers to capture all sorts of operational data
* [ECS](https://github.com/elastic/ecs) - The Elastic Common Schema (ECS) defines a common set of fields for ingesting data into Elasticsearch. A common schema helps you correlate data from sources like logs and metrics or IT operations analytics and security analytics.
